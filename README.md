# 📄 Kannan’s Resume Graveyard ⚰️✨  

Welcome to the holy archive of every resume I’ve ever sacrificed to the ATS gods.  
Each version here represents me tweaking fonts, rewording bullet points, and pretending I cracked the secret formula to a 100/100 ATS score.

### 🪶 Files
**Kannan Hora.pdf** → The latest masterpiece (probably still being rejected somewhere right now).  
**Resume(dd-mm-yy).pdf** → My past experiments in the art of “beating the bots.”

### 🧠 GitHub for my career drafts
This repo is basically GitHub for my career drafts:  

> 💬 Every commit = “Fixed one typo, lost two opportunities.”  
> 📝 Every update = “Surely THIS version will pass ATS.”  
> 📁 Every file = A résumé-shaped coping mechanism.

Enjoy the evolution of my job-hunting journey 🎢💼
